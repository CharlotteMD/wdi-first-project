Pseudocode

Start with what variables you will need
Then define what functions will be needed to operate parts of the game logic
Then have event listeners to run the game logic in order

Div 1 - CCTV

The game starts when the player presses the start game button.
Event Listener - listen for start button to be clicked, then start cctv randomise function.
The CCTV div needs to show a random combination of a suspects face made up of 3 images.
Function 1 - create CCTV suspect - div cctv creates a random suspect from a randomised eye, nose and mouth image.
Function 2 - show CCTV suspect - function 1 combination of facial features is shown over div 1 for ten seconds (or less for higher levels), then it disappears

***Potential game bug - if you can select facial features while the CCTV image is still being shown***

Div 2 - Mugshot & Div 3 - Face Selectors

Event Listener - face selectors needs to be disabled until the CCTV image has disappeared

Div 3 is divided into 3 selectors (more in later levels). When a selector is chosen, it changes the corresponding image on the mugshot div.
Event Listener - when a selector is changed, the image is also changed on the mugshot div

Submit button - winning & losing

When the submit button is pressed, the facial features on div 1 & 2 are compared.
Event Listener - wait for the submit button to be pressed then run the face comparison function
Function 3 - Compare faces - eyes, nose, mouth - if they all match, run win sequence, if they dont match, run lose sequence
Function 4 - win sequence - sound effect & prison bars fall over div 2
Function 5 - lose sequence - sound effect, div 2 shakes & disappears
